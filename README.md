# K-Means Clustering with Data Visualization

This repository contains a Python implementation of k-means clustering on the Iris dataset along with data visualization.

## Overview

The code performs k-means clustering on the Iris dataset, visualizes the clustered data, and shows the centroids of the clusters.

## Requirements

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pratirath06/K-Means-Clustering.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd K-Means-Clustering
    ```

3. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python K-Means-Clustering.ipynb
    ```

## Visualization

The script generates plots that visualize the clustered data and the centroids.
